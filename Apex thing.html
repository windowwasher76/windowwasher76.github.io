    <p> Lifeline "The Combat medic" is good, because of her ability to res her teamnates while fighting, which is her passive. She can place down her drone on them and then head straight in to battle. With quick thinking and staying behind cover lifeline can be an essential for a good team. She can heal herself and her teamnates really quick with her tactical.She has been nerfed and no longer has a sheild while she is reviving her teamnates, which is why I am only putting her at #5.</p>
    
    <li>Octane</li>

    </a>
    <p>Octane is a speed demon. He can wipe out whole teams before they even notice he is there with his passive. He is very good for pushing the other team and scouting out. He has a good ultimate letting him get even more speed than his tactical. His passive goes with his tactical because he can heal with his passive, while his tactical makes him take damage. The only reason I am only putting him at #4 is because he is not really a team player. If I put something like top 5 duos I might of put him higher, but since it's trios he is not as good. Hard pushing in trios is harder especially when your way in front of your team.</p> 
    <li>Valkyrie</li>
    
    <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Valkyrie">
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yuzg3e4uAmdeb4hRieCP25.jpg" width="300px">
    </a>
    <p>Valk Has a unique ability. She can fly up in the air to avoid contact or get to different points. She is a good choice because she can confuse and completely out manuver these other people witshing that they were playing valk. She has a good tactical that can help destroy cover and an ultimate that can server for a quick getaway or a way to pinpoint the enemies.</p>
    <li>Bloodhound</li>

    <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodhound">
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ2c_9ZYV9JzgqkQ7yTVH2M0tID6lGU6ikSUw&usqp=CAU" width="300 px">
    </a>
    <p>For starters, bloodhound has a passive that can find clues to where the other team ran off too. Not only that, but he has a really good tactical, which lets him scan his surrounding area letting him locate the people nearby for a short few seconds. His ultimate is useful, because it makes him faster, making it easier to stalk his prey. He also has thermal in that mode which is very good because it gives you a better view of the enemy.</p>
    <li>Gibraltar</li>
    
    <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gibraltar">
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ_jG6EwzjSXKzDfW2k1JrnB6x0DqBg6ylqXg&usqp=CAU" width="300 px">
    </a>
    <p>The man, the myth, the legend. Gibraltar. Gibraltar is THE WAY to go if you are struggling getting kills. His passive gives him a sheild protecting him from loads of damage, he is also a defender, which means he takes 15% less damage. Which it may not seem like it but that's A LOT. His tactical also gives him a bubble which makes him and his team invincible. Making him a LITERAL bullet sponge. You can put three mags in to him and he wouldn't even notice. And im not even talking about with a red shield. He is a very boring to play legend, but it is worth it if you need a few quick wins.</p>
